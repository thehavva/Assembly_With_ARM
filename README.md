Translation language, or assembly language (English to English: assembly language), is the processor that performs all the processing in a computer, and the processor has its own language called machine language. The processor only understands this language and you negotiate using that language. But this language is very difficult to learn and use. For this reason, software has been developed that speaks in a language that humans can understand and then translates it into the language of the processor. These are called compilers. Compilers also have a language, but it is much easier than the language of the processor. One of these compiler languages ​​is Assembly. An assembly language is a low-level language used for writing computer programs. The use of human-friendly symbols (English: mnemonics) in the software of assembly language programs replaced the direct programming work in the digital machine code of a target computer, which was more error-prone and time-consuming than was used in the first computers. An assembly language program is translated into the machine code of the target computer by a useful program called the translator (English: assembler). (A translator is different from a compiler, and it usually does one-to-one (isomorphic) translations from “English: mnemonic” expressions to machine commands.)<br/>

Assembly language is a low-level programming language used to write complex programs. Assembly creates an environment for low-level programming by replacing numerical expressions of machine language that are difficult for humans to understand with alphabetical expressions that are easier to understand and program. The purpose of using assembly is to ensure that the programs written on the first computers contain less errors and take less time.<br/>

In this repository, I will be sharing the open code of the questions and small projects I solved while learning assembly.
